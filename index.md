## More about me
I'm focused on developing compassionate and kind leaders in the Fintech space. I workshop and improve the content creation process to bring technical documentation to customers quickly. To do this well we must: be kind, and do good work. That is my leadership philosophy.

I lead a team of professional writers for a software company. 

Along the way I started a business on Etsy called <a href="https://vinyljunction.com" target="_blank">Vinyl Junction</a> selling vintage music and books.

I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring new music.
