## Adam Pugh's Portfolio
### Writer | Entrepreneur | Leader | Designer
My professional writing career began in college creating content for the Arizona Daily Wildcat. Now I lead a team of professional writers for a software company. Along the way I started a business on Etsy called <a href="https://vinyljunction.com" target="_blank">Vinyl Junction</a> selling vintage music and books.

I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring new music.
