# Adam Pugh's Portfolio
## Technical Writer | Leader | Designer

My name is Adam and I am a writer, leader, and curious person.

#### More about me
As a Documentation Engineer at Meta, I focus on writing clear, helpful documentation for our Recruiting software products and processes, mainly for our internal wiki. I've led documentation teams to create effective content strategies, improve processes through data, and use analytics to make better decisions. I'm skilled with tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel Power Query, and I'm experienced with content management systems such as Tridion Docs, SharePoint, and Wiki. I also know how to use web documentation languages like HTML, Markdown, CSS, and XML.

I believe in leading with kindness and striving for top-notch work. This straightforward approach shapes how I handle documentation and manage teams at Meta, aiming for clear communication and strong leadership without the fluff.
