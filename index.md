## Entrepreneur, Writer, Leader
My professional writing career began in college creating content for the Arizona Daily Wildcat. Now I lead a team of professional writers for a software company. Along the way I started a business on Etsy called [Vinyl Junction](https://vinyljunction.com) selling vintage music and books.

I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring new music.
